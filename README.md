# My Discord : React application

## Introduction

Welcome ! This repository contains the frontend part of the clone of the Discord web application I implemented. For the backend part please check out this [repository](https://github.com/syoupheng/my-discord-gql-api).

## Installation

### Requirements

If you want to try this application on your local machine you will first need to launch the GraphQL API and the database (instructions [there](https://github.com/syoupheng/my-discord-gql-api)).

You will also need to have **nodeJS v18+** installed. The use of tool like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is recommended in order to manage different versions of NodeJS.

### Environment variables

Once this is done you will have to create a `.env` file at the root of the project. You can copy the variables that you will find in the .`env.example` file. If needed change the variables to reflect the url of your backend.

### Installing dependencies

All the dependencies required for this project can be installed with the `npm install` command.

## Start the React application

In order to launch the frontend application use the `npm run dev` command. Have fun ðŸ˜Š !
